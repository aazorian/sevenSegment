# sevenSegment
Supporting MATLAB code for running a four digit, seven segment display using an arduino Uno.
This was done as project for an independent study course. The intent of the project was to see if a seven segment, multiplexing display could be successfully run using a MATLAB commanded arduino.
This display would run without any backpack chip and need for supporting libraries. Instead, the pins of the display would connect direclty to the arduino.
